	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 6-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; Water bodies still face, to a limited extent, some water quality challenges, mostly related to pollution due to returns from irrigation and urban effluents upstream in neighboring countries (in some of the shared basins) and due to mining activity, unregulated land uses in some watercourses and saline intrusion. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; Mozambique is located downstream from all basins shared with other countries, except for the Rovuma basin. In some of these basins there is already an intensive use of water in the upstream countries, especially in agriculture &lt;/p&gt;</data>
