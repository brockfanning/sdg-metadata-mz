	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 15-1-1, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; The five sub-indicators chosen to illustrate progress towards sustainable forest management do not fully cover all aspects of sustainable forest management. In particular, social and economic aspects are summarized in the sub-indicators of areas under sustainable forest management plans. In addition, as trends are calculated using only countries that have complete time series of data, different sub-indicators may reflect different sets of countries. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; While the panel illustrates the progress of the individual sub-indicators, there is no consideration of the relative importance of the sub-indicators &lt;/p&gt;</data>
