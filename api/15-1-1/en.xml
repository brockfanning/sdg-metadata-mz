 &lt;p&gt; According to FAO definitions, Floresta is defined as: “land covering more than 0.5 hectares with trees over 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10%, or trees capable of reaching these thresholds in situ . It does not include land predominantly under agricultural or urban use ”. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Hectares (Ha) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Classifications are not used. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ministry of Land and Environment (National Directorate of Forests), National Forest Inventory &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The data related to the indicator are collected in the National Forest Inventory whose details on the collection, quality control, measured variables, used equipment, measurement procedures, rigor and precision in the use and handling of the equipment are described in the National Forest Inventory Guidelines. Based on the results of the inventory, the specific areas that qualitatively respond to the indicator are described. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Until December 2027 &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; August 2028 &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ministry of Land and Environment &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ministry of Land and Environment &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; According to the Organic Statute of the Ministry of Land and Environment, which was approved by Resolution No. 30/2016 of October 31, published in the Boletim da República I Série - Number 85, the Ministry of Land, Environment and Rural Development, directs , plans and coordinates, controls and ensures the implementation of policies in the fields of Land and Geomatics Administration, Forests and Wildlife, Environment, Climate Change and Conservation Areas. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The indicator provides a measure of the relative extent of the forest in a country. The availability of accurate data in a country&apos;s forestry area is an essential element for forest policy and planning in the context of sustainable development. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; The forest area as a percentage of the total land area can be used as an &lt;em&gt; proxy &lt;/em&gt; approximate the extent to which a country&apos;s forests are being conserved or restored, but it is only partly a measure of the extent to which they are managed in a manner sustainable. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The five sub-indicators chosen to illustrate progress towards sustainable forest management do not fully cover all aspects of sustainable forest management. In particular, social and economic aspects are summarized in the sub-indicators of areas under sustainable forest management plans. In addition, as trends are calculated using only countries that have complete time series of data, different sub-indicators may reflect different sets of countries. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; While the panel illustrates the progress of the individual sub-indicators, there is no consideration of the relative importance of the sub-indicators &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; Forest area (reference year) / land area (2015) * 100 &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; This indicator can be aggregated at the global or regional level, adding all country values globally or in a specific region &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; The proportion of forest area in the protected area and in the management plan is calculated using the reported areas and the official land area of FAOSTAT for the reference year 2015. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; After the production of the information related to the indicator, which is produced by the National Directorate of Forests, it proceeds with its validation by the Consultative Council of the Ministry of Land and Environment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The detailed methodology and guidance on how to prepare Country reports through an online web platform and convert national data according to national categories and definitions to FAO global categories and definitions can be found in the documents &quot;Guidelines and Specifications&quot; ( www.fao.org/3/I8699EN/i8699en.pdf) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; A specific quality management system does not yet exist, however, the Forest Information System (SIF) is being operationalized, which was created with the aim of giving greater credibility to the information made available. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Use of satellite image that makes it possible to analyze the data of the areas covered in the forests and which are available in the National Forest Inventory. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; No quality assessment has yet been carried out, according to standard quality criteria established by the United Nations &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The indicator is made available every ten years and has no breakdown. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This indicator is internationally comparable. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/forest&quot;&gt; http://www.fao.org/forest &lt;/a&gt; -ressourses-assessment-en /, National Forest Inventory 2017 &lt;/p&gt;</data>
