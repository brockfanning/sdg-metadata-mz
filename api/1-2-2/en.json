For example, 53.3% of people in Mozambique are private in more than 40% of the weighted indicators. </p> <p> The multidimensional poverty assessment can be influenced by the weighting of the indicators and, or the definition of the limit (cutoff). </p> <p> For the analysis of multidimensional poverty in Mozambique, the methodology <em> Alkire-Foster </em> was used. This methodology allows the aggregation of dimensions and deprivation indicators. Our assessment was based on 17 indicators. As binary indicators, they can assume two values, 0 if the household is “non-private” and 1 if it is “private” for that indicator. Weights are assigned to dimensions and indicators. Subsequently, the limit (cutoff) of 40% of the heavy indicators was defined. Finally, private households at least 40% of private indicators were considered poor, and private households at less than 40% were considered non-poor. To calculate the Multidimensional Poverty Index of <em> Alkire-Foster </em> we use the following formula: </p>\n <p> Where: </p> <p> 1. The data used are reliable at national, rural, urban and provincial levels; </p>\n <p> 2. Internal discussion at the level of the National Directorate for Economic Policy and Development, the Ministry of Economy and Finance, at the level of the Government, discussion with cooperation partners and civil society. </p> <p> In the process of creating the Quality Management System at the level of the National Statistical System. </p> <p> There is a team composed of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the National Institute of Statistics and the World Bank that collaborates from the moment of the formulation of IOF surveys, data collection, and dissemination of results. </p> <p> The instruments for assessing the quality of statistical processes and products at the level of the National Statistical System are still being developed based on the 19 quality principles established by the United Nations Statistical Commission. </p> <p> Data available every 6 years, disaggregated by area of residence (rural and urban), sex, age group and <em> status </em> (type) of occupation. </p> <p> It is possible to make a comparison considering the Global MPI, but some need to be done in terms of weights and indicators and dimensions. </p> <ul>\n   <li> DEEF (2016).
