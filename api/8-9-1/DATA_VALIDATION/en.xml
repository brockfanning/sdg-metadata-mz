	<message>The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 8-9-1, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; The VABDT is derived from the GVA of productive activities that directly serve tourism and, therefore, it may be possible to break down by tourism industries (for example, accommodation for visitors, different types of passenger transport, etc.). &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; The indicator is based on the Tourism Satellite Account (CST): Recommended Methodological Framework SNA 2008, an international standard adopted by the UN Statistical Commission and developed by the World Tourism Organization (WTO), Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) ) European Union Statistics Office and EUROSTAT. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
