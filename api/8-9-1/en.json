The value of the economic contribution of tourism captured by this indicator, and its (relative) increases or decreases, may indicate the degree to which tourism is being successfully promoted. </p> <p> Given that this indicator is produced as the sum of the various activities that make up the domestic consumption of tourism, the late reception of data from sources; lack or insufficiency of resources to carry out surveys at regular intervals may lead to skewed production estimates from the Tourism Satellite Account (CST). </p>\n <p> The VABDT / GDP tends not to show great variations from one year to the next and the variations may be due to the numerator and / or denominator, this means that the true dimension of the indicator does not have variation. </p> <p> Direct Gross Value Added by Tourism VABDT as a share of GDP in% </p>\n <p> Growth Rate of VABDT </p>\n <p> ((VABDT <sub> t </sub> / VABDT <sub> t-1 </sub>) -1) * 100 </p> <p> The VABDT is derived from the GVA of productive activities that directly serve tourism and, therefore, it may be possible to break down by tourism industries (for example, accommodation for visitors, different types of passenger transport, etc.). </p>\n <p> The indicator is based on the Tourism Satellite Account (CST): Recommended Methodological Framework SNA 2008, an international standard adopted by the UN Statistical Commission and developed by the World Tourism Organization (WTO), Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) ) European Union Statistics Office and EUROSTAT. </p> <p> The data compiled and verified by the technicians are reconciled by the heads and submitted to the directors for recheck. </p> <p> Use of United Nations manuals and compliance with the United Nations recommended reviews: </p>\n <p> - National Accounts (SNA 2008); </p>\n <p> -World Tourism Organization (WTO), </p>\n <p> -Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development (OECD) </p>\n <p> -European Union and EUROSTAT Statistics Office. </p> <p> Sharing with international publications institutions. </p> <p> Data are made available annually and have no desegregation </p> <p> Calculation of this indicator does not differ from calculations made internationally, because United Nations manuals are used for National Accounts, SNA 2008; compliance with the reviews recommended by the United Nations. </p> <p> National Accounts (SNA 2008); </p>\n <p> -World Tourism Organization (WTO), </p>\n <p> -Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development (OECD) </p>\n <p> -European Union and EUROSTAT Statistics Office. </p>\n <p> http://www.ine.gov.mz/estatisticas/estatisticas-economicas/contas-nacionais </p>"}
