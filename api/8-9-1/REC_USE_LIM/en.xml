	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 8-9-1, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; Given that this indicator is produced as the sum of the various activities that make up the domestic consumption of tourism, the late reception of data from sources; lack or insufficiency of resources to carry out surveys at regular intervals may lead to skewed production estimates from the Tourism Satellite Account (CST). &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; The VABDT / GDP tends not to show great variations from one year to the next and the variations may be due to the numerator and / or denominator, this means that the true dimension of the indicator does not have variation. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
