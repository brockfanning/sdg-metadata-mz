{"status":"success","message":"The RATIONALE field for indicator 6-2-1, translated into en","data":" <p> International consultations since 2011 have established consensus on the need to develop and address the shortcomings of this indicator; specifically, to address normative criteria for the human right to water, including accessibility, acceptability and security. In addition, safe management of faecal waste must be considered, as discharges of untreated wastewater into the environment create risks to public health. These consultations concluded that the post-2015 targets, applicable to all countries, must go beyond the basic level of access and address indicators of safe management of sanitation services, including dimensions of accessibility, acceptability and security. </p>\n <p> The Expert Working Group requested analysis of faecal waste management along the sanitation chain, including containment, emptying of latrines and septic tanks and safe disposal at the site or transport and treatment of waste at a designated treatment site. The treatment classification will be based on the categories defined by the SEEA and the International Recommendations for Water Statistics and following a ladder approach (primary, secondary and tertiary treatment). </p>"}
