	<message>The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 6-2-1, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; The recommended data source to calculate this indicator is the Census and Household Surveys. The data collection questionnaire is designed and subsequently tested in the field in the course of training the interviewers. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; For data collection, we applied the methodology of interviews face to face with households, where respondents were asked if the house has: flush toilets inside the house, flush toilet outside the home, toilet without flush toilet, latrine improved, improved traditional latrine. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; The field work lasted 15 days in the case of the Censuses and the Surveys depending on the type and purpose of the Survey. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; Cases of non-response, after all efforts to obtain funds are exhausted, are treated as unknown cases. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
