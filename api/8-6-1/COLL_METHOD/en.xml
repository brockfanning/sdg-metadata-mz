	<data> &lt;p&gt; The recommended data source to calculate this indicator &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; are the Family Budget Surveys. The data collection questionnaire is designed and subsequently tested in the field in the course of training the interviewers. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; The IOF 2014/2015 is a probabilistic, stratified and multi-stage survey, designed according to a panel methodology based on households residing in private homes. In other words, each selected household (PA) was visited four times during the complete 12-month cycle, once only in each quarter, in order to reflect seasonality during the year. The visit to each household lasted 7 continuous days. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; Data collection took place over 12 months starting on August 7, 2014 and ending on August 15, 2015 &lt;/p&gt;</data>
