	<data> &lt;p&gt; The sustainability of fishing is defined based on the abundance of stocks. In order to know the abundance of stocks, it is necessary to carry out an inventory assessment using fish catch statistics, fishing effort data and biological information and adjust the data to a population dynamics model. Upon completion of the assessment of all stocks concerned, fish stocks with an abundance equal to or greater than the level associated with maximum sustainable yield are counted as biologically sustainable and otherwise considered to be overfishing. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
