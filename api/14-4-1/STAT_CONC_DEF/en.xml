	<data> &lt;p&gt; Definition: Measure of the sustainability of the capture of a marine fishing resource in relation to its abundance. A stock of fish whose abundance is at or above the level, which can produce maximum sustainable yield (MSY), is classified as biologically sustainable. On the other hand, when the abundance falls below the MSY level, the stock is considered biologically unsustainable. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; Concept: the long-term sustainability of fishery resources is measured through the process of scientific assessment of the fish stock as it is fished to the level that produces maximum sustainable catch. The basic benchmarks for the sustainability of fisheries are established by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, Article 61 (3).</data>
