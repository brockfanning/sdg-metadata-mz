A stock of fish whose abundance is at or above the level, which can produce maximum sustainable yield (MSY), is classified as biologically sustainable. On the other hand, when the abundance falls below the MSY level, the stock is considered biologically unsustainable. </p>\n <p> Concept: the long-term sustainability of fishery resources is measured through the process of scientific assessment of the fish stock as it is fished to the level that produces maximum sustainable catch. The basic benchmarks for the sustainability of fisheries are established by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, Article 61 (3). <p> Percentage </p> <p> Ministry of the Sea, Inland Waters and Fisheries (National Institute for Fisheries Research) </p> <p> February 2021 </p> <p> III Quarter of 2021 </p> <p> National Institute for Fisheries Research </p> <p> Ministry of the Sea, Inland Waters and Fisheries </p> <p> Joint Dispatch, of 4 December 2003, Boletim da República nº 16, of 21 April 2004 The National Statistics Institute, through the Minister of Protection, delegates powers to the National Directorate of Fisheries Economics of the Ministry of Fisheries, for the notation and collection of statistical data for all statistics in the sector, by taking advantage of administrative acts and inquiries. Joint Order, of December 4, 2003, Bulletin of the Republic No. 16, of April 21, 2004 The National Statistics Institute, through the Minister of Guardianship, delegates powers to the National Directorate of Fisheries Economics of the Ministry of Fisheries, for the notation and compilation of statistical data for all sector statistics, by taking advantage of administrative acts and inquiries. </p> <p> The assessment of the proportion of fish stocks within the biologically sustainable levels allows to ensure that fishery resources are exploited within the biologically sustainable levels, that is, at the MSY level. </p> <p> The indicator very well establishes the sustainability of the capture of fishery resources. However, its derivation does not only require data, but also requires stock assessment, a process that must be carried out by species, thus challenging for countries with multispecific fisheries, such as in tropical countries. </p> <p> The sustainability of fishing is defined based on the abundance of stocks. In order to know the abundance of stocks, it is necessary to carry out an inventory assessment using fish catch statistics, fishing effort data and biological information and adjust the data to a population dynamics model. Upon completion of the assessment of all stocks concerned, fish stocks with an abundance equal to or greater than the level associated with maximum sustainable yield are counted as biologically sustainable and otherwise considered to be overfishing. </p> <p> The processed information is screened and analyzed at a technical level where it is then submitted to the Institution's Technical Council for pre-approval, where after verifying the information it healthily goes to the Advisory Council for approval of the data or information produced at a later time dissemination </p> <p> The national indicator is internationally comparable as it is based on internationally accepted standards. </p>\n <p> Uses the same methodology for calculating the global indicator </p> <p> The processed information is screened and analyzed at a technical level where in turn it is submitted to the Institution's Technical Council these strata are composed of qualified scientists for the purpose of verification and validation </p> <p> The instruments for assessing the quality of statistical processes and products at the level of the National Statistical System are being developed based on the 19 quality principles established by the United Nations Statistics Commission. </p> <p> Data for the calculation of the indicator exist at the National Fisheries Research Institute (IIP), however it is up to the National Fisheries Administration (ADNAP) and the National Operations Directorate (DNOP) to make it available annually. </p>\n <p> The data is not disaggregated </p> <p> The national indicator is internationally comparable as it is based on internationally accepted standards. </p>\n <p> Uses the same methodology for calculating the global indicator. </p>"}
