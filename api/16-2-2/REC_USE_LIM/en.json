{"status":"success","message":"The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 16-2-2, translated into en","data":" <p> The number of victims of trafficking identified allows referring to victims, as defined in the UN Protocol, where the act, average and purpose of trafficking were identified by national authorities. </p>\n <p> While data on identified victims can provide valuable information for monitoring the sex and age profile of victims, as well as on forms of exploitation and trafficking flows, the number of victims identified alone does not monitor the level of human trafficking. Therefore, trends should be interpreted with caution, as changes in identified victims of trafficking may be due to several factors, such as the intensity of trafficking flows, but also changes in law enforcement practices, changes in legislation or victims' attitudes. </p>"}
