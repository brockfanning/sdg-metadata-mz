{"status":"success","message":"The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 3-7-1, translated into en","data":" <p> Differences in the design and implementation of the survey, as well as differences in the way the questionnaires are formulated and administered, can affect the comparability of the data. The most common differences are related to the variety of contraceptive methods included and the characteristics (age, sex, marital status or union) of the people for whom the prevalence of contraceptives is estimated (base population). The timeframe used to assess the prevalence of contraceptives can also vary. In most surveys, there is no definition of what is meant by \"currently using\" a contraceptive method. In some surveys, the lack of probing questions, asked to ensure that the respondent understands the meaning of different contraceptive methods, may result in an underestimation of the prevalence of contraceptives, particularly in traditional methods. Sample variability can also be a problem, especially when the prevalence of contraceptives is measured for a specific subgroup (according to the method, age group, education level, place of residence, etc.) or when analyzing trends over time . When data on women aged 15 to 49 are not available, information is reported for women who are married or in union. Illustrations of grassroots populations that are sometimes presented are: married or married women aged 15 to 44, sexually active women (regardless of marital status) or married women. The notes in the data set indicate any differences between the data presented and the standard definitions of contraceptive prevalence or unmet need for family planning or where the data belong to populations that are not representative of women of reproductive age. </p>"}
