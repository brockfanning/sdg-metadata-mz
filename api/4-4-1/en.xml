Data is collected at the provincial digital resource centers and some at the ICT training centers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; March of each year &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; December each year &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ministry of Science and Technology, Higher Education and Professional Technician through the National Institute of Electronic Government. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ministry of Science and Technology, Higher Education and Professional Technician through the National Institute of Electronic Government. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Ministry and delegated organ of Statistics Portugal. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; Produces statistics from the Science and Technology, Higher Education and Professional Technical Sector according to the joint order of December 2002, Bulletin of the Republic no &lt;sup&gt; o &lt;/sup&gt; 10, Series, of March 5, 2003. a0679c9a6a6d43 &lt;p&gt; This indicator links the use and impact of ICT and helps to measure and track the level of proficiency of users. A high value indicates that a large portion of the reference population has ICT skills. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The data collected to calculate the indicator do not capture information from private training centers that teach courses in the areas of ICT and are not disaggregated by type of skill. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This indicator is obtained by the ratio between the number of young people and adults who have ICT skills and the total population resident in the country, multiplied by 100%. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The results of this operation are analyzed by the department of studies and statistics and then presented to the technical and advisory councils of the ministry for the purposes of assessment and final validation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To produce this indicator, methodological guidelines are used, which are included in the globally available metadata, the difference is in the fact that globally they use the type of specific skills while at the national level they apply all kinds of skills. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In process the creation of the management system at the level of the national statistical system, however at the level of the ministry there is a department to manage the quality of statistical products: &lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;li&gt; Collection and made through administrative acts. &lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt; To guarantee the quality required in the Statistics production process, the sector uses all correlated administrative information sources, in order to complement, validate and measure the information obtained. Also during the process of analysis and establishment of the data values, the sources of origin of the basic information are questioned whenever there are doubts or anomalous variations in the results obtained. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The instruments for assessing the quality of statistical processes and products at the level of the national statistical system are being developed based on the 19 quality principles established by the united nations statistics commission. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The data for this indicator are available annually and are not broken down by type of skill. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The determination of this indicator differs from the international one in that it relates people with ICT skills and the total population residing in the country and not a specific age group. The other aspect refers to the data source, for this indicator the data source used for the calculation is administrative and not survey. The calculation is not done by type of skill considers all skills. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Annual Balance of Activities of the CTESTP Sector. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
