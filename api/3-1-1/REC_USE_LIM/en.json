{"status":"success","message":"The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 3-1-1, translated into en","data":" <p> The extent of maternal mortality in a population is essentially the combination of two factors: </p>\n <ol>\n   <li> The risk of death in a single pregnancy or a single birth; </li>\n   <li>. The level of fertility (that is, the number of pregnancies or births experienced by women of reproductive age). The maternal mortality ratio (RMM) is defined as the number of maternal deaths over a given period of time per 100,000 live births during the same period. It describes the risk of maternal death in relation to the number of live births and essentially captures factor (i) above. On the other hand, the maternal mortality rate (TMM) is calculated as the number of maternal deaths divided by person years experienced by women of reproductive age. TMM captures the risk of maternal death due to pregnancy or by total birth (birth or death) and the level of fertility in the population. In addition to RMM and TMM, it is possible to calculate the risk of maternal mortality in adulthood for women in the population (see Table A2.2). An alternative measure of maternal mortality, the proportion of deaths among women of reproductive age due to maternal causes (MP), is calculated as the number of maternal deaths divided by the total number of deaths among women aged 15 to 49 years. Statistical measures related to maternal mortality: </li>\n </ol>\n <p> Maternal mortality ratio (RMM): Number of maternal deaths during a certain period of time per 100,000 live births in the same period; </p>\n <p> Maternal mortality rate (TMM): Number of maternal deaths divided by year per person lived by women of reproductive age. </p>\n <p> Risk of maternal death in adulthood: the probability that a 15-year-old woman will eventually die from a maternal cause. </p>\n <p> The proportion of deaths among women of reproductive age due to maternal causes (MP): The number of maternal deaths in a given period of time divided by the total number of deaths among women aged 15 to 49 years. </p>\n <p> There are often data quality problems, mainly related to underreporting and incorrect classification of maternal deaths </p>"}
