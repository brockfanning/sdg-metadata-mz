There is substantial agreement in the literature that women who become pregnant and give birth very early in their reproductive lives are at higher risk of complications or death during pregnancy and childbirth than their peers, and their children are also at greater risk of morbidity. and death than children born to older women. Therefore, preventing births too early in a woman's life is an important measure to improve maternal health and reduce child mortality. In addition, having children at a young age reduces a woman's opportunities for socioeconomic improvement, mainly because young mothers are less likely to continue to study and, if she needs to work, may find it especially difficult to combine family and professional responsibilities. The birth rate of adolescents also provides indirect evidence of young people's access to health services, as young people, in particular single adolescents, often experience difficulties in accessing sexual and reproductive health services. </p>"}
