There is substantial agreement in the literature that women who become pregnant and light very early in their reproductive lives are subject to higher risks of complications or death during pregnancy and childbirth than their peers, and their children are also at greater risk of morbidity and death than children born to older women. Therefore, preventing births too early in a woman&apos;s life &amp;#xE9; an important measure to improve maternal health and reduce child mortality. In addition, having children at an early age reduces a woman&apos;s socioeconomic improvement opportunities, mainly because young mothers are less likely to continue to study and, if she need to work, they may find it especially difficult to combine family and professional responsibilities. The birth rate of adolescents also provides indirect evidence of young people&apos;s access to health services, j &amp;#xE1; whereas young people, in particular single adolescents, tend to have difficulties in accessing sexual and reproductive health services. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
