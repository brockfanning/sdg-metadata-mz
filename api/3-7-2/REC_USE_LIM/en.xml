	<data> &lt;p&gt; Discrepancies between data sources at country level are common and the level of adolescent fertility rate depends in part on the source of the selected data. For the civil registry, fees are subject to limitations that depend on the integrity of the birth registry, on the treatment of live born babies, but who die before registration or in the first 24 hours of life, on the quality of the reported information related to age of the mother, and the inclusion of births from previous periods. Population estimates may be subject to limitations related to incorrect declarations of age and coverage. For survey and census data, the numerator and denominator are from the same population. The main limitations concern the incorrect declaration of age, omissions of birth, incorrect declaration of the child&apos;s date of birth and sample variability in the case of surveys. With regard to fertility rate estimates among adolescents aged 10 to 14 years, comparative evidence suggests that a very small proportion of births in this age group occurs in women under 12 years of age. Other evidence based on historical retrospective birth data from surveys indicates that women aged 15 to 19 are less likely to report first births before age 15 than women in the same birth cohort when asked five years later, aged 20 and 24 years old. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
