	<data> &lt;p&gt; The discrepancies between data sources at the level of the country are common and the level of the fertility rate of adolescents depends in part on the source of the data selected. For civil registration, fees are subject to limitations that depend on the integrity of the birth register, the treatment of babies born alive, but who die before registration or in the first 24 hours of life, the quality of the information reported related to the age of the mother, and the inclusion of births from previous periods. Population estimates may be subject to limitations related to incorrect declaration of age and coverage. For survey data and censuses, the numerator and denominator are from the same population. The main limitations relate to the incorrect age statements, birth omissions, incorrect child&apos;s date of birth and sample variability in the case of inquiries rites. With regard to the estimates of the fertility rate among adolescents aged 10 to 14 years, comparative evidence suggests that a very small proportion of births in this age group. ria occurs in women under 12 years of age. Other evidence based on historical retrospective data from births of surveys indicates that women aged 15 to 19 years are less likely to report first births before age 15 than women from the same birth cohort when asked five years later, aged between 20 and 24 years. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
