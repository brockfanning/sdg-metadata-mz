	<data> &lt;p&gt; Birth rate in adolescents aged 10 to 14 years and 15 to 19 years (birth rate in adolescents per 1,000 women) &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; The birth rate of adolescents represents the risk of becoming pregnant among women of a certain age group. The adolescent birth rate (ABR) is also called &lt;strong&gt; specific fertility rate &lt;/strong&gt; (ages 15-19), a designation commonly used in the context of calculating total fertility estimates. A related measure is the proportion of adolescent fertility, measured as the percentage of total fertility contributed by women aged 15 to 19 &lt;/p&gt;</data>
