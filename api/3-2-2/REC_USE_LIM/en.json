It is an indicator of public health monitoring because it reflects the access of children and communities to basic health interventions, such as vaccination, medical treatment of infectious diseases and adequate nutrition. </p>\n <p> The under-five mortality rate, as defined here, is not, strictly speaking, a rate (that is, the number of deaths divided by the number of populations at risk over a given period of time), but a probability of death derived from a life table and expressed as a fee per 1000 live births. </p>"}
