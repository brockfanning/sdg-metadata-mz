	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 3-2-2, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; Mortality rates among young children are a key indicator of measuring child health and well-being and, more broadly, for social and economic development. It is an indicator of public health monitoring because it reflects the access of children and communities to basic health interventions, such as vaccination, medical treatment of infectious diseases and adequate nutrition. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; The under-five mortality rate, as defined here, is not, strictly speaking, a rate (that is, the number of deaths divided by the number of populations at risk over a given period of time), but a probability of death derived from a life table and expressed as a fee per 1000 live births. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
