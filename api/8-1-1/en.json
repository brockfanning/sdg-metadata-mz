Real GDP per capita is calculated by dividing GDP at constant prices by the population of a country or region. Real GDP data is measured in constant US dollars to facilitate the calculation of the country's growth rates, their respective aggregation and comparability between countries or regions. </p> <p> Percentage </p> <p> Classification of economic activities (CAE), National Classification of Goods and Services (CNBS); Classification of Non-Profit Institutions to Family Services (COPNI); Classification of Government Functions (COFOG), Classification Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP) Balance of Payment Manual, Version 6 (MBOP6) </p> <p> Monthly surveys, Annual surveys, Administrative data </p> <p> Monthly and annual business surveys are current, probabilistic surveys.
