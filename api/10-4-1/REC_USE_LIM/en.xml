	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 10-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; Mozambique has a high bar of self-employed workers or in the informal sector, remuneration estimates can be underestimated, since the periodicity of the Family Budget Survey (IOF) is 5 years, a period considered long; &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; The failure to carry out certain surveys on the scheduled date for budgetary reasons, leads institutions to make estimates that can be biased. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; GDP can exclude or underestimate activities that are difficult to measure, such as transactions in the informal sector or in illegal markets, etc., underestimating GDP. In addition, GDP is not responsible for the social and environmental costs of production and is therefore not a good measure of the general level of well-being. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
