	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 10-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; The share of labor in GDP seeks to inform about the relative share of GDP accumulated for workers compared to the accumulated share for capital in a given reference period. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; To effectively interpret this indicator, it is important to consider it, simultaneously, with economic growth trends. The share of labor remuneration in national production can highlight the extent to which economic growth translates into higher earnings for employees over time. It can be a proxy for the standard of living indicator for workers, depending on the distribution of real income and public policies adopted, among other factors &lt;/p&gt;</data>
