	<data> &lt;p&gt; Although in most developed countries the unemployment rate continues to prove useful as an important indicator of labor market performance and, specifically, as a key measure of underutilization of labor, in many developing countries, however, the significance and significance of the unemployment rate can be questioned. In the absence of unemployment insurance systems or social safety nets, people of working age must avoid unemployment by resorting to some form of economic activity, albeit insignificant or inadequate. Thus, in this context, other measures must supplement the unemployment rate to comprehensively assess the underutilization of labor. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
