The statistical operation is national in nature, as it covers Scientific Research Institutions (IIC), Higher Education Institutions (IES), Companies and Private Non-Profit Institutions (IPSFL) in the country. </p>\n <p> In the Survey, the census is used to collect data in Higher Education Institutions and Scientific Research Institutions located in the national territory, taking into account the reduced universes of these Institutions. As for Private Non-Profit Companies and Institutions (IPSFL), Stratified Proportional Sampling is used due to the enormous size of the universe. </p>\n <p> Data Collection, Processing and Analysis </p>\n <p> Data collection is based on physical and online questionnaires, combined with the face-to-face interview method, sending questionnaires by e-mail and links that allow access to the online questionnaires of the Information System (e-Survey). Data pre-processing is done automatically in the Information System (e-Survey).
