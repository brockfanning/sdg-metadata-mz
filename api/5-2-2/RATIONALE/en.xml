	<data> &lt;p&gt; Data on the prevalence of violence against women and girls are needed to measure the magnitude of the problem; understand the various forms of violence and its consequences; identify high-risk groups; explore barriers to seek help; and ensure that appropriate responses are provided. This data is the starting point for informing laws, policies and developing effective responses and programs, as needed. They also allow countries to monitor changes over time and evaluate the effectiveness of their interventions. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
