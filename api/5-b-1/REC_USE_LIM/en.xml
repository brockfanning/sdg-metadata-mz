	<data> &lt;p&gt; Although data on the “proportion of individuals who own a cell phone” currently exists for only very few countries, the ITU is encouraging all countries to collect data on this indicator through national surveys and the indicator is expected to be added to the list of indicators of the Partnership on ICT Measurement for development.
