	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 5-b-1, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; The possession of the cell phone, in particular, is important for tracking gender equality, as the cell phone is a personal device that, if owned and not just shared, provides women with a certain degree of independence and autonomy, including for purposes professionals. Several studies have highlighted the link between cell phone ownership and empowerment and productivity growth. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; Existing data on the proportion of women who have a cell phone suggests that fewer women than men have a cell phone. This indicator highlights the importance of cell phone ownership to track and improve gender equality, and monitoring will help develop policies aimed at overcoming gender inequality. The collection of this indicator was proposed by the Gender Working Group of the Partnership on ICT Measurement for Development. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
