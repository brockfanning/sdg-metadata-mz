	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 8-7-1, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; Although the concept of child labor includes work in activities of a dangerous nature, to ensure comparability of estimates over time and to minimize data quality problems, work beyond age-specific time limits is used as a proxy for dangerous work for the purpose of reporting indicator 8.7.1. Additional methodological work is needed to validate issues specifically designed to identify children in dangerous working conditions. Likewise, while the worst forms of child labor that are not dangerous are also part of the concept of child labor more broadly, data on the worst forms of child labor are currently not captured in surveys of regular households due to difficulties in measuring it accurately and reliably &lt;/p&gt;</data>
