	<data> &lt;p&gt; Many children in the world remain trapped in child labor, compromising their individual future and our collective future. According to the most recent global ILO estimates, about 152 million children worldwide - 64 million girls and 88 million boys - are children, representing almost 10% of the child population. These evident numbers emphasize the need for accelerated progress against child labor by 2025 - the target date for ending child labor in all its forms and the need for child labor statistics to monitor and guide efforts in this direction. Reliable, comprehensive and timely data on the nature and extent of child labor provide a basis for determining priorities for global national action against child labor. Statistical information on child labor and, more broadly, on all working children, also provides a basis for raising public awareness of the situation of working children and for the development of appropriate regulatory frameworks and policies &lt;/p&gt;</data>
