{"status":"success","message":"The RATIONALE field for indicator 8-7-1, translated into en","data":" <p> Many children in the world remain trapped in child labor, compromising their individual future and our collective future. According to the most recent global ILO estimates, about 152 million children worldwide - 64 million girls and 88 million boys - are children, representing almost 10% of the child population.
