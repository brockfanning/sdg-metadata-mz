	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 1-2-1, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; The indicator is reliable, since the IOF data are representative at national, rural, urban and provincial levels. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; Limitations: In general, the great limitation in the calculation of this indicator comes from the general underestimation of household food consumption, evidenced by the low caloric consumption levels recorded in many areas of the country, and mainly due to problems in the collection of consumption data. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
