Each household would be surveyed 4 times during the complete cycle (1 cycle = 12 months) and for 4 weeks of the month. Coverage rate 98.7%, 89.1% and 91.3% for the 1st, 2nd and 4th quarter, respectively. For several reasons, we did not have the 3rd quarter. </p>\n <p> <a href=\"http://www.ine.gov.mz/operacoes-estatisticas/inqueritos/inquerito-sobre-orcamento-familiar/relatorio-final-do-inquerito-ao-orcamento-familiar-iof-2014-15\"> <u> http://www.ine.gov.mz/operacoes-estatisticas/inqueritos/inquerito-sobre-orcamento-familiar/relatorio-final-do-inquerito-ao-orcamento-familiardi8-4- </p> <p> Until the first semester of 2021 </p> <p> Until December 2021 </p> <p> National Institute of Statistics (INE) </p> <p> Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) </p> <p> By joint order number <strong> 112 / DEAE-MF / 2012 of 8 June </strong>, the National Statistics Institute delegated powers of notation and clearance of statistical data from administrative acts and inquiries to the Ministry of Finance through the Directorate of Studies and Economic Analysis . </p> <p> Poverty Index shows the percentage of people living on less than 26.7 meticais per day. For example, 46.1% means that 41.1% of people in Mozambique are poor, that is, they live on less than 26.7 meticais per day. </p> <p> The indicator is reliable, since the IOF data are representative at national, rural, urban and provincial levels. </p>\n <p> Limitations: In general, the great limitation in the calculation of this indicator comes from the general underestimation of household food consumption, evidenced by the low caloric consumption levels recorded in many areas of the country, and mainly due to problems in the collection of consumption data. </p> <p> The assessment of consumption poverty in Mozambique is based on the Basic Needs Cost approach, in which a poverty line is derived that includes food and non-food consumption, the limit at which those below are considered poor, and whoever is at the limit or above is considered to be non-poor. To calculate poverty we use the Foster, Greer and Thorbecke (FGT) indices, so for this indicator, we use the following Poverty Incidence Index: </p>\n <p> Where: </p> <p> 1. The data used are reliable at national, rural, urban and provincial levels; </p>\n <p> 2.

And the discussion with partners and civil society. </p> <p> In the process of creating the Quality Management System at the level of the National Statistical System. </p> <p> There is a team composed of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the National Institute of Statistics and the World Bank that collaborates from the moment of the formulation of IOF surveys, data collection, and dissemination of results. </p> <p> The instruments for assessing the quality of statistical processes and products at the level of the National Statistical System are still being developed based on the 19 quality principles established by the United Nations Statistical Commission. </p> <p> Data available every 6 years.
