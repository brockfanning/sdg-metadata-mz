	<data> &lt;p&gt; 1 ERADICATE POVERTY IN ALL ITS FORMS, EVERYWHERE &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; 1.2 By 2030, reduce at least half the proportion of men, women and children, of all ages, living in poverty, in all its dimensions, according to &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; 1.2.1 Proportion of the population living below the national poverty line, (people living under MZN 26.7 per day) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Population below the national poverty line. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; 8/10/2020 &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Jos√© Domingos Madeira Cardoso &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; National Directorate for Economic Policies and Development &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Senior Technician N1 &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; +258 84 229 5957 &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:jsm.cardoso7@gmail.com&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt; jsm.cardoso7@gmail.com &lt;/u&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The national poverty rate is the percentage of the total population living below the national poverty line defined as MZN26,7. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Percentage &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We do not use any classifier &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ministry of Economy and Finance, calculated based on the results of the IOF 2014/2015. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The IOF 2014/15, was a panel survey, which ran from August 7, 2014 to August 15, 2015. 11,628 households were interviewed, 6,380 from urban areas and the remaining 5,248 from rural areas. Each household would be surveyed 4 times during the complete cycle (1 cycle = 12 months) and for 4 weeks of the month. Coverage rate 98.7%, 89.1% and 91.3% for the 1st, 2nd and 4th quarter, respectively. For several reasons, we did not have the 3rd quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

For example, 46.1% means that 41.1% of people in Mozambique are poor, that is, they live on less than 26.7 meticais per day. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The indicator is reliable, since the IOF data are representative at national, rural, urban and provincial levels. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; Limitations: In general, the great limitation in the calculation of this indicator comes from the general underestimation of household food consumption, evidenced by the low caloric consumption levels recorded in many areas of the country, and mainly due to problems in the collection of consumption data. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The assessment of consumption poverty in Mozambique is based on the Basic Needs Cost approach, in which a poverty line is derived that includes food and non-food consumption, the limit at which those below are considered poor, and whoever is at the limit or above is considered to be non-poor. To calculate poverty we use the Foster, Greer and Thorbecke (FGT) indices, so for this indicator, we use the following Poverty Incidence Index: &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; Where: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; 1. The data used are reliable at national, rural, urban and provincial levels; &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; 2. Internal discussion at the level of the National Directorate of Policies and Economic Development, of the Ministry of Economy and Finance. And the discussion with partners and civil society. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In the process of creating the Quality Management System at the level of the National Statistical System. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; There is a team composed of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the National Institute of Statistics and the World Bank that collaborates from the moment of the formulation of IOF surveys, data collection, and dissemination of results. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The instruments for assessing the quality of statistical processes and products at the level of the National Statistical System are still being developed based on the 19 quality principles established by the United Nations Statistical Commission. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Data available every 6 years. Disaggregated by area of residence (rural and urban), region (South, Center and North), sex, province, age group and &lt;em&gt; status &lt;/em&gt; (type) of occupation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This indicator cannot be compared with other countries, as the composition of the basket as well as the cost of purchasing it, varies from country to country. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;
