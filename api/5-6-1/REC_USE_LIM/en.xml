	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 5-6-1, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; Women who make their own decision to seek medical care are considered to be able to exercise their reproductive rights. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; A key limitation is that the current estimates of the indicator are based on women currently married or in union at the age of reproduction (15 to 49 years) who are using any type of contraception. In the current Demographic and Health Survey (IDS), the question about decision making on contraceptive use is asked only of women who currently use contraceptive methods. As questions about decision-making about sexual relations and health care are restricted to women (15 to 49) currently married or in union, the denominator of Indicator 5.6.1 is women aged 15 to 49, currently married or in union and currently using contraception. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
