	<data> &lt;p&gt; The autonomy of women and girls in making decisions about consensual sexual relations, the use of contraceptives and access to sexual and reproductive health services is essential for their empowerment and the full exercise of their reproductive rights. The woman&apos;s ability to say &quot;no&quot; to her husband / partner, if she does not want to have sex, is well aligned with the concept of women&apos;s sexual autonomy and empowerment. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; Women who make their own decision regarding seeking medical care are considered to be able to exercise their reproductive rights &lt;/p&gt;</data>
