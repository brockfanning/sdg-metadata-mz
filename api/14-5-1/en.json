It is important to note that several specific management objectives are recognized in this definition, covering conservation, restoration and sustainable use: </p>\n <ul>\n   <li> Category Ia: strict nature reserve </li>\n   <li> Category Ib: wild area </li>\n   <li> Category II: National Park </li>\n   <li> Category III: Monument or natural feature </li>\n   <li> Category IV: habitat / species management area </li>\n   <li> Category V: Protected Landscape / Sea View </li>\n   <li> Category VI: Protected area with sustainable use of natural resources </li>\n </ul>\n <p> \"Designated\" status is assigned to a protected area when the corresponding authority, in accordance with national law or common practice (for example, by means of an executive decree or similar), officially endorses a designation document. The designation must be made for the purpose of biodiversity conservation, and not for de facto protection arising from some other activity (for example, military). </p>\n <p> Locations that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity are identified following standard global criteria for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas (IUCN 2016) applied at the national level. Two variants of these standard criteria have been applied in all countries to date. The first is for the identification of Important Birds and Biodiversity Areas, that is, places that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, identified by means of data on birds, and more than 12,000 locations have been identified in all countries of the world ( BirdLife International 2014). The second is for the identification of sites of the Alliance for Zero Extinction (Ricketts et al. 2005), that is, sites that effectively maintain the entire population of at least one species assessed as Critically Endangered or Endangered on the Red List of Threatened Species IUCN. In total, 587 Alliance for Zero Extinction sites were identified for 920 species of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, conifers and coral reef builders. A global standard for identifying key areas of biodiversity that unifies these approaches, along with other mechanisms for identifying important sites for other species and ecosystems, has been approved by IUCN (2016). </p> <p> Percentage (%) </p> <p> Ministry of the Sea, Inland Waters and Fisheries (National Institute for Fisheries Research) & National Authority for Conservation Areas (ANAC) </p> <p> Bibliographic review of documents </p> <p> February 2021 </p> <p> III Quarter of 2021 </p> <p> National Institute for Fisheries Research </p> <p> Ministry of the Sea, Inland Waters and Fisheries </p> <p> Joint Dispatch, of 4 December 2003, Boletim da República nº 16, of 21 April 2004 The National Statistics Institute, through the Minister of Protection, delegates powers to the National Directorate of Fisheries Economics of the Ministry of Fisheries, for the notation and collection of statistical data for all statistics in the sector, by taking advantage of administrative acts and inquiries. </p> <p> The establishment of conservation areas is an important mechanism to combat the decline of marine biodiversity and guarantee the long-term sustainable use of marine resources </p> <p> The indicator does not measure the effectiveness of protected areas in reducing biodiversity loss, which ultimately depends on a series of management and inspection factors not covered by the </p> indicator <p> Ratio between the sum of the geographical areas of marine conservation areas declared based on national legislation and the total marine area multiplied by 100 </p> <p> The processed information is screened and analyzed at a technical level where it is then submitted to the Institution's Technical Council for pre-approval, where after verifying the information it healthily goes to the Advisory Council for approval of the data or information produced at a later time dissemination </p> <p> Main differences lie in the source of calculation data for the indicator.
