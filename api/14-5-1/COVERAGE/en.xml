	<data> &lt;p&gt; These data are made available annually. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; Data on current coverage of marine conservation areas are existing and held by the National Conservation Areas Authority (ANAC), which is the national entity responsible for managing the national network of conservation areas. However, the existing data, although they were not considered disaggregated in the calculation of the indicator, offer the possibility for this by categories of protection. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
