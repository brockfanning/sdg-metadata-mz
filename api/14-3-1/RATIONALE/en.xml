	<data> &lt;p&gt; Part of the CO2, emitted into the atmosphere as a result of natural and anthropogenic processes, is absorbed by the oceans, changing its chemical composition and progressively acidifying the ocean. Acidification results in a decrease in pH and the observed decrease in the pH of seawater has been shown to affect a variety of organisms and ecosystems, biodiversity and food security. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
