The average marine acidity, the concentration of hydrogen ions on a logarithmic scale, is expressed in pH. In order to restrict the carbonate chemistry of seawater, it is necessary to measure at least two of the four parameters, ie pH, pCO <sub> 2 </sub>, DIC (CT) and TA (AT). pH (the concentration of hydrogen ions on a logarithmic scale, expressed in full scale), DIC (total dissolved inorganic carbon, in μmol kg-1), pCO <sub> 2 </sub> (partial pressure of carbon dioxide, in ppt or μatm) and TA (TA, total alkalinity, in μmol kg-1). </p>"}
