Estimates include direct and indirect beneficiaries. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The coverage of social protection programs is the percentage of the population that benefit from social protection programs.

Annual report of the PES of the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Action (MGCAS) and data from the denominator are from the Population and Housing Census and INE projections &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Delegations of the National Institute of Social Action collect the data and introduce it into the INAS Information System on line (e-INAS) and the National Institute of Social Action (INAS), in turn harmonizes, verifies and makes validation based also on the reports sent periodically by the delegations. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; INAS in turn sends the periodic report to the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Action for final validation and sent to the District Health, Women and Social Action Services and Provincial Social Affairs Services. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; Population data are collected at INE &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; 27 December 2020 &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; 20 January 2021 &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Delegations of the National Institute of Social Action &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Action &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ministerial Diploma No. 117/2015, of December 31; decree nº 47/2018, of 6 August, presidential decree nº 9/2015 of 13 March, resolution nº 18/2015 of 10 July &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The focus is that all poor families are beneficiaries of Protection Programs (Social Assistance) The higher the percentage means the greater coverage of poor households &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The indicator is reliable, as data are collected at source at national level and are disaggregated by target group (direct beneficiary), sex of the head of household and Province. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; Limitations: The available data do not allow the use of the global indicator formula, as the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Action has not yet started to implement social transfers per person in accordance with Decree 47/2018, of 6 August. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Coverage = Number of Households benefiting from Social Protection (Social Assistance) Programs / Poor and vulnerable households according to the IV Poverty Assessment in Mozambique X100 &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Analyzed at the level of the Technical Council and validated by the Advisory Council of the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Action &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The guidance given internationally or globally and the use of the population below the poverty line but the country uses households below the poverty line &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The report data are analyzed by the Monitoring and Evaluation Division team, by the head of the Planning Department, by the Director of planning and cooperation, by the Technical Council and finally by the Advisory Council of the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Action. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; During the data collection process, the INAS team controls the quality of the data that the Delegations report before being sent to the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Action. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; Comparison of the information for the current period with that of the previous period and also with the planned one. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; Check the veracity of the data with INAS and the delegations &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Action is organizing the statistics area to work in coordination with the National Statistics Institute (INE) to improve the quality of the entire process, from data collection to data publication &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Data are available annually and are disaggregated by sex of the head of household, Province and Target group &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This indicator cannot be compared with other countries, as households are used in the calculation process instead of population. This is because, at the moment, the Assistance Programs make social transfers to the household and not to the individual. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mgcas.mz.co&quot;&gt; www.mgcas.mz.co &lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;
