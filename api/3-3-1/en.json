In addition, during the data collection, a strict control was established at the level of each team over the collection process, by detecting errors by the field critics, which allowed for immediate correction still on the ground.

The MEASURE DHS Program aims to: </p>\n <p> • Support the formulation of policies and implementation of programs in the areas of population and health; </p>\n <p> • Increase the international population and health data base for monitoring and evaluation; </p>\n <p> • Improve the survey methodology by sampling, and </p>\n <p> • Consolidate, in the survey area, the technical capacity of the executing institution in the country participating in the Program. </p> <p> Quality Management Instrument still to be approved </p> <p> The interactive and batch processing of information through the CSPro program also allowed, at central level, the periodic obtaining of partial results, for analysis of the data collected until a given moment, through the production of tables for monitoring and quality control.

The introduction of CAFE at IMASIDA 2015 ensured that the questionnaires started to be edited in the field, using a portable computer. After completing the questionnaires on paper and completing all interviews in the household, the interviewers and health technicians delivered the questionnaires to the field typist. The field typist, in conjunction with the team controller, reviewed the questionnaires and then typed them in the Census and Survey Process (CsPro) version 4.0. This typing process in the field allowed the detection of inconsistencies or omissions in the questionnaires, as well as the correction of them even on the ground, with the presence of the team in the conglomerate </p> <p> Ministry of Health (MISAU), <a href=\"http://www.misau.gov.mz\"> www.misau.gov.mz </a>; </p>\n <p> National Statistics Institute (INE), <a href=\"http://www.misau.gov.mz\"> www.misau.gov.mz </a>; </p>\n <p> ICF International (ICFI), <a href=\"http://www.measuredhs.com\"> www.measuredhs.com </a> </p>"}
