	<message>The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 3-3-1, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; The recommended data sources for calculating this indicator are Household Surveys. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; At IMASIDA, four questionnaires were used: &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; - Questionnaire for households; &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; - Individual questionnaire for young and adult women aged 15-59 years; &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; - Individual questionnaire for young men and adults aged 15-59 years and &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; - Biometry questionnaire for men and women aged 15-59 years. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; The four questionnaires were subsequently determined based on the findings of the pre-test of the survey, carried out between 14 April and 11 May 2014 &lt;/p&gt;</data>
