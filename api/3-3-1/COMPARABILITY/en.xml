	<data> &lt;p&gt; In the data processing process, standard DHS Program procedures for CAFE4 inquiries were applied. The introduction of CAFE at IMASIDA 2015 ensured that the questionnaires started to be edited in the field, using a portable computer. After completing the questionnaires on paper and completing all interviews in the household, the interviewers and health technicians delivered the questionnaires to the field typist. The field typist, in conjunction with the team controller, reviewed the questionnaires and then typed them in the Census and Survey Process (CsPro) version 4.0. This typing process in the field allowed the detection of inconsistencies or omissions in the questionnaires, as well as the correction of them even on the ground, with the presence of the team in the conglomerate &lt;/p&gt;</data>
