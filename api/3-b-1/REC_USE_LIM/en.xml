	<data> &lt;p&gt; Vaccination is the first line of defense against various infectious diseases and is the most successful and cost-effective public health intervention to reduce child mortality and improve child health. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; An unvaccinated child can face serious illnesses, including potentially untreatable illnesses that can prove to be deadly. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; The rationale for selecting a set of vaccines reflects the ability of immunization programs to deliver vaccines throughout the life cycle and to adapt new vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; Given that the HPV vaccine is relatively new and the vaccination schedule varies from country to country, coverage estimates will be made for girls vaccinated at age 15 and, at the moment, data are limited to very few countries, therefore, reports will start later. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
