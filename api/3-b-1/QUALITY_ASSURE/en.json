The first level consisted of identifying the AEs by checking the reference maps or sketches, followed by confirming the AE at the central level, using data sent from computers equipped with a GPS system and online in the field. The first level of quality control helped to identify the central point of each enumeration area with a margin of error of ten meters from the center of the enumeration area. The second level of quality control consisted of checking the questionnaires by the team's controller and the field typist, after filling in the questioner, checking for inconsistencies and following the filters through the programming done in the CsPro program in the field and double typing process typing and critical analysis at the central level (central typing). </p>\n <p> Throughout the data processing process, standard DHS Program procedures for CAFE6 surveys were applied.
