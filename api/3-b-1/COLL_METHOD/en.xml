	<message>The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 3-b-1, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; Data collection took place between 8 June and 20 September 2015, the fieldwork was carried out by 25 teams. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; The design of the sample consists of three stages. &lt;em&gt; In the first &lt;/em&gt;, the sample was stratified by province and urban / rural area and then 307 primary sampling units (UPA) were selected, through systematic selection of equal probability. &lt;em&gt; In the second step &lt;/em&gt;, an enumeration area (AE) was selected from each of the 307 primary sampling units with probability proportional to the size of the AEs, resulting in a selection of 134 AEs in urban areas and 173 AEs in rural areas. &lt;em&gt; In the third stage &lt;/em&gt;, all households (PA) were listed in each of the 307 AEs. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; The listing was conducted systematically, using files specially designed for the purpose. The complete list of households was used to select the 24 households eligible for interviews in each EA. Based on this procedure, 7,368 households were selected for the survey. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; four questionnaires were used: one to interview households, one individual for 15-59 year old women, one individual for 15-59 year old men and another biometric for 15-59 year old men and women. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; During the survey, 7,368 households were selected, of which 7,342 were present and 7,169 agreed to conduct the household interview, which resulted in a 98% response rate. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
