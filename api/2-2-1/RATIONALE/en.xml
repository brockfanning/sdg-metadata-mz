	<data> &lt;p&gt; Child growth is an internationally accepted result, reflecting children&apos;s nutritional status. Infant dwarfism refers to a very young child for the age and is the result of chronic or recurrent malnutrition.

Atrophied children are unable to reach their physical and cognitive potential. Child stunting is one of the indicators of the World Health Assembly&apos;s nutrition goal. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
