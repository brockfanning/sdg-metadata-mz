	<message>The DATA_COMP field for indicator 2-2-1, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; Survey estimates are based on standardized methodology, using the WHO Child Growth Standards, as described in (Ref: Anthro software manual). Global and regional estimates are based on the methodology described in UNICEF-WHO, World Bank: Joint child malnutrition estimates - Levels and trends (UNICEF / WHO / BM 2012) &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; To assess the nutritional status of children, weight and height measurements were used. Based on these measures, it is possible to produce indicators of the nutritional status of the population, that is, height for age (H / A), weight for height (H / A) and weight for age (H / A). &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; The relationship between height and age or the A / I index is an indicator that reflects a situation of chronic malnutrition. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
