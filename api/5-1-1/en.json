The score for each area (a number between 0 and 100) therefore represents the percentage of that country's achievements in that area, with 100 being best practices answered in all questions in the area. The choice to present all four scores in the area without additional aggregation is the result of adopting the stance that high values in one area in one country need not compensate in any way for the country with low values in some other area and that a comprehensive examination The value of these four numbers for each country is potentially more informative than trying to summarize all four numbers in a single index. </p> <div class=\"footnotes\"> <div> <sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-2\"> 2 </sup> <p> For questions 1 and 2, the methodology does not give a positive or negative score to the existence or are subject to the existence of a Therefore, in countries where customary or personal law does not apply, these questions are classified as \"N / A\" and are not included as part of the overall score calculation for the 'comprehensive legal frameworks and public life' area. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-2\"> ↑ </a> </p> </div> <div> <sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-3\"> 3 </sup> a0d0d0n0d0n0d0n0d <a href=\"#footnote-ref-3\"> ↑ </a> </p> </div> </div> <p> Validation is done by the collective by the national gender direction then by the technical and advisory council </p> <p> The method used is in accordance with international measurement standards of this indicator </p> <p> The data are analyzed by the Monitoring and Evaluation Division team, by the head of the Planning Department, by the Director of planning and cooperation, by the Technical Council and finally by the Advisory Council of the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Action </p> <p> Working with gender focal points contributes to the quality of the answers given to the questions 45 questions that contribute to the calculation of the indicator </p> <p> The Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Action is organizing the statistical area to work in coordination with the National Statistics Institute (INE) to improve the quality of the entire process, from data collection to data publication. </p> <p> The data is disaggregated into Four areas of law: (i) comprehensive legal frameworks and public life; (ii) violence against women; (iii) employment and economic benefits; and (iv) marriage and family. </p> <p> This indicator is global and can be compared with other countries. </p> <p> www.mgcas.mz.co </p>"}
