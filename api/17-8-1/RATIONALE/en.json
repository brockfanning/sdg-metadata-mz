{"status":"success","message":"The RATIONALE field for indicator 17-8-1, translated into en","data":" <p> The Internet has become an increasingly important tool for accessing public information, a relevant means of protecting fundamental freedoms. The number of Internet users has increased substantially in the past decade and access to the Internet has changed the way people live, communicate, work and do business. Internet adoption is a key indicator for policy makers and others to measure the development of the information society and the growth of Internet content - including user-generated content - providing access to increasing amounts of information and services. Despite the growth in networks, services and applications, access and use of information and communication technologies (ICT) are still far from being distributed equitably, and many people still cannot benefit from the potential of the Internet. This indicator highlights the importance of using the Internet as a facilitator of development and helps to measure the digital divide, which, if not addressed properly, will exacerbate inequalities in all areas of development. Variables used to classify individuals who use the Internet - such as age, sex, education or employment status - can help identify digital disparities in individuals who use the Internet. This information can contribute to the design of policies aimed at overcoming these disparities. The proportion of people using the Internet is an established indicator and also one of the three indicators of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) related to ICT (for Goal 8F). It is part of the Main List of Indicators of the Partnership for Measuring ICT for Development, which was endorsed by the UN Statistics Commission (in 2014). It is also included in the ITU ICT Development Index and is therefore considered a key measure for international comparisons of ICT developments. </p>"}
