	<message>The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 17-8-1, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; The indicative proportion of people using the Internet is based on an internationally agreed definition and methodology, which were developed under the coordination of the ITU, through its Groups of Experts and after an extensive consultation process with the countries. It is also a central indicator of the List of Core Indicators of the Partnership on ICT Measurement for Development, which was endorsed by the UN Statistics Commission (in 2014). Data on individuals who use the Internet are collected through surveys of families and through the general population and housing census. Administrative records are an alternative source &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; This indicator is calculated by dividing the total number of people in the scope who accessed the internet by the total number of people in the scope. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
