	<data> &lt;p&gt; Mortality rates among young children are a key indicator of measuring child health and well-being and, more broadly, for social and economic development. It is an indicator of public health monitoring because it reflects the access of children and communities to basic health interventions, such as vaccination, medical treatment of infectious diseases and adequate nutrition. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
