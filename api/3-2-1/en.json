Introduction • 13 In one third of the IDS household sample, interviews were also conducted with all eligible men found.

It is an indicator of public health monitoring because it reflects the access of children and communities to basic health interventions, such as vaccination, medical treatment of infectious diseases and adequate nutrition. </p> <p> The indicator is calculated by dividing the number of deaths of children aged 0 to 59 months (< de 5 anos) num determinado período e o número médio de crianças com idade entre os 0 a 59 meses (< 5 anos) durante o mesmo período de tempo</p> <p> The field work had close supervision and quality control by the central and provincial technicians, both from INE, MISAU and ICF International staff. In addition, during the data collection, a strict control was established at the level of each team over the collection process, by detecting errors by the field critics, which allowed for immediate correction still on the ground. At the level of central coordination, the data critics carried out a further review of the base data and the problems encountered were communicated to the respective teams. </p>\n <p> The interactive and batch processing of information through the CSPro program also allowed, at central level, the periodic obtaining of partial results, for analysis of the data collected until a given moment, through the production of tables for monitoring and quality control.

The MEASURE DHS Program aims to: </p>\n <p> • Support the formulation of policies and implementation of programs in the areas of population and health; </p>\n <p> • Increase the international population and health data base for monitoring and evaluation; </p>\n <p> • Improve the survey methodology by sampling, and </p>\n <p> • Consolidate, in the survey area, the technical capacity of the executing institution in the country participating in the Program. </p> <p> Quality Management Instrument still to be approved </p> <p> The interactive and batch processing of information through the CSPro program also allowed, at central level, the periodic obtaining of partial results, for analysis of the data collected until a given moment, through the production of tables for monitoring and quality control.
