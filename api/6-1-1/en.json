Access to drinking water and a good hygiene environment are an important lever, as they allow to reduce most diseases that occur in children and adults, for example, diarrhea can be reduced through good hygiene practices, use of drinking water and adequate sanitary means. </p> <p> Data on the availability and safety of drinking water is increasingly available through a combination of household surveys and administrative sources, including regulators, but definitions still need to be standardized. </p> <p> The proportion is given by the quotient between people who consume water from safe sources for the total population. As a percentage </p> <p> The fieldwork had the supervision and quality control by the technicians of INE Central as well as the Provincial Delegations. In addition, during the data collection, a strict control was established at the level of each team over the collection process, by detecting errors by the critics in the field, which allowed for immediate correction even on the ground. </p>\n <p> At the level of central coordination, the data critics made a further review of the base data and the problems encountered were reported to the respective teams for correction. </p>\n <p> Interactive and batch processing of information also allowed, at central level, the periodic obtaining of partial results, for analysis of the data collected until a given moment, through the production of tables for monitoring and quality control. The results of these tabulations were reported in feedback to the inquirers, ensuring the quality of the data. </p> <p> In the production and compilation of data, methodologies recommended by the United Nations were used in <strong> <em> Principles and Recommendations of the Population and Housing Censuses (ST / ESA / STAT / SER.M / 67 / Rer.3) <p> Still in development and to be approved by the quality management instrument </p> <p> For the collection of data, the methodology of interviews was applied face to face to the households filling out the Bulletin of Households and Bulletin of collective accommodations. </p> <p> Still in development and for approval of the instrument for quality assessment </p> <p> Information is made available every 5 years and is broken down by rural and urban area of residence, province and country </p> <p> Data production allows comparability with no differences, as the internationally defined recommendations in <strong> <em> Principles and Recommendations for Civil Statistics - UN follow (ST / ESA / STAT / SER.M / 19 / Rev.3 New York, 2014 ) </em> </strong> </p>\n <p> Estimates of Demographic and Health Surveys are based on standardized methodologies and developed by WHO and UNICEF. </p>\n <p> The Demographic and Health Survey (IDS) in Mozambique is part of an international survey program (MEASURE DHS) developed by ICF International through a contract with USAID, with the purpose of supporting governments and private institutions in developing countries in conducting national surveys by sampling, in the areas of population and health.
