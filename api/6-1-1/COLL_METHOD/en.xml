	<message>The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 6-1-1, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; The recommended data source to calculate this indicator is the Census and Household Surveys. The data collection questionnaire is designed and subsequently tested in the field in the course of training the interviewers. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; For the collection of data, the methodology of interviews was applied face to face to the households where the respondents were asked what was the main source of water they use to drink and the answer was highlighted in a list of sources that include: water channeled inside the neighbor&apos;s house, yard, land or house; taps or public fountains; holes or fountains; protected wells; unprotected wells, springs; packaged water; supplied water, river / lake water and rainwater. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; The field work lasted 15 days in the case of the Censuses and the Surveys depending on the type and purpose of the Survey. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; Cases of non-response, after all efforts to obtain funds are exhausted, are treated as unknown cases. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
