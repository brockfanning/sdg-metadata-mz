	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 6-b-1, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; Defining the procedures in the policy or law for the participation of local communities is vital to ensure that the needs of the entire community are met, including the most vulnerable, and also encourages the appropriation of schemes that, in turn, contribute to their sustainability . A low value for this indicator suggests that the participation of local communities in water and sanitation management is low, while a high value indicates high levels of participation, indicating greater ownership and greater likelihood of sustainable delivery and management of water and sanitation services. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
