Local administrative units refer to districts, municipalities or other local units of the community that cover urban and rural areas to be defined by the Government </p> <p> Percentage </p> <p> Ministry of Public Works, Housing and Water Resources (National Directorate of Water Supply and Sanitation): Administrative data. </p> <p> Data are collected through Meetings and, or institutional work meetings of the technical planning teams </p> <p> The next data collection is expected to take place by December 2020 </p> <p> January 2021 </p> <p> Ministry of Public Works, Housing and Water Resources </p> <p> Ministry of Public Works, Housing and Water Resources </p> <p> In accordance with Ministerial Diploma No. 72/2012, INE delegated powers of notation and calculation of statistical data to the MOPH, through the Bakery and Cooperation Directorate which has the following duties: (i) to prepare and coordinate the planning process of the area Aguaz and Sanitation; (ii) preparing medium and long-term plans for the water sector and monitoring its implementation; (iii) monitor the execution of investment plans and propose corrective measures; and, (iv) assess and monitor the activities in the area </p> <p> Defining the procedures in the policy or law for the participation of local communities is vital to ensure that the needs of the entire community are met, including the most vulnerable, and also encourages the appropriation of schemes that, in turn, contribute to their sustainability . A low value for this indicator suggests that the participation of local communities in water and sanitation management is low, while a high value indicates high levels of participation, indicating greater ownership and greater likelihood of sustainable delivery and management of water and sanitation services. </p> <p> The country has a legal framework of policies and standards that assign competences at local levels to the participation of communities in the management of water supply and sanitation services. Although such a situation exists, there are problems in the operationality of the committees due to the fact that their members do not have the necessary technical expertise in this area. </p> <p> The value of the indicator is obtained by the quotient between the number of local administrative units with policies and operating procedures for local participation and the total number of local administrative units in the country. All administrative units in the country, in terms of both District and Municipal Governments, have an established and operational mechanism by which individuals and communities contribute significantly to decisions and guidelines on water and sanitation management. </p> <p> Monitoring of the results of data compilation is carried out by technicians from the Ministry of Public Works, Housing and Water Resources </p> <p> In the process of creating the Quality Management System at the level of the National Statistical System. </p> <p> Meetings with the main players in the integrated water resources management process for data collection and analysis of its consistency. </p> <p> The instruments for assessing the quality of statistical processes and products at the level of the National Statistical System are still being developed based on the 19 quality principles established by the United Nations Statistical Commission. </p> <p> Data are made available annually and have no breakdown. </p> <p> Uses the calculation methodology defined by the United Nations. </p> <p> Water Law (Law No. 16/91 of August 3; Action Plan for the Implementation of the Water Supply and Sanitation Development Goals 2015-2030, <em> Resolution Nr. 40/2018, of October 24, 2018 </em>; PRONASAR </p>"}
