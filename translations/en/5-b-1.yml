STAT_CONC_DEF: >2-
   <p> This indicator is defined as the "proportion of individuals aged 3 years and over who have a cell phone, by sex, area of residence and province". </p>
   <p> An individual is the holder of a cell phone if he / she has a cell phone device with at least one active SIM card for personal use. Mobile cell phones provided by employers that can be used for personal reasons (to make personal calls, access the Internet, etc.) are included. Individuals who have only active SIM card (s) and not a cell phone device are excluded. Also included are individuals who have a cell phone for personal use that is not registered in their name. It is considered an active SIM card if it is a SIM card used in the last three months. A mobile phone (cell phone) refers to a portable phone through which you subscribe to a public mobile phone service using cellular technology, which provides access to PSTN. This includes analog and digital cellular systems and technologies, such as IMT-2000 (3G) and IMT-Advanced. Postpaid phone users and prepaid accounts are included. </p>

   <p> The recommended data source for calculating this indicator is the Censuses and Household Surveys. This indicator is calculated by dividing the total number of people in the scope who have a cell phone by the total number of people in the scope. </p>

RATIONALE: >2-
   <p> The possession of the cell phone, in particular, is important for tracking gender equality, as the cell phone is a personal device that, if owned and not just shared, provides women with a certain degree of independence and autonomy, including for purposes professionals. Several studies have highlighted the link between cell phone ownership and empowerment and productivity growth. </p>
   <p> Existing data on the proportion of women who have a cell phone suggests that fewer women than men have a cell phone. This indicator highlights the importance of cell phone ownership to track and improve gender equality, and monitoring will help develop policies aimed at overcoming gender inequality. The collection of this indicator was proposed by the Gender Working Group of the Partnership on ICT Measurement for Development. </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >2-
   <p> Although data on the “proportion of individuals who own a cell phone” currently exists for only very few countries, the ITU is encouraging all countries to collect data on this indicator through national surveys and the indicator is expected to be added to the list of indicators of the Partnership on ICT Measurement for development. The number of countries with official data for this indicator is expected to increase in the near future. </p>

   <p> Countries can collect data on this indicator through national household surveys. This indicator is calculated by dividing the total number of people in the scope who have a cell phone by the total number of people in the scope. </p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >2-
   <p> The field work had close supervision and quality control by the central and provincial technicians, both from INE Central and from the Provincial Delegations. In addition, during the data collection, a strict control was established at the level of each team over the collection process, by detecting errors by the field critics, which allowed for immediate correction still on the ground. At the level of central coordination, the data critics carried out a further review of the base data and the problems encountered were communicated to the respective teams. </p>
   <p> Interactive and batch processing of information also allowed, at central level, the periodic obtaining of partial results, for analysis of the data collected until a given moment, through the production of tables for monitoring and quality control. The results of these tabulations were reported in feedback to the inquirers, ensuring the quality of the data. </p>

   <p> This is a newly developed ITU indicator that was approved by the 2014 World Telecommunication / ICT Indicators (WTIS) Symposium. The definition and methodology of the indicator were developed under ITU coordination, through its Groups of Experts and after an extensive consultation process with countries. The main source of data are administrative records, household surveys (IOF and FinScope) and the General Population and Housing Census. </p>

   <p> For the collection of data, the methodology of interviews was applied face to face to the households. </p>

COMPARABILITY: >2-
   <p> The definition and methodology of the indicator were developed under the coordination of the ITU, through its Groups of Experts and after an extensive consultation process with countries </p>
   <p> Comparability is guaranteed since the Demographic and Health Survey (IDS) in Mozambique is part of an international survey program (MEASURE DHS) developed by ICF International through a contract with USAID, with the purpose of supporting governments and private institutions in developing countries to carry out national sample surveys in the areas of population and health. The MEASURE DHS Program aims to: </p>
   <p> • Support the formulation of policies and implementation of programs in the areas of population and health; </p>
   <p> • Increase the international population and health data base for monitoring and evaluation; </p>
   <p> • Improve the survey methodology by sampling, and </p>
   <p> • Consolidate, in the survey area, the technical capacity of the executing institution in the country participating in the Program. </p>
