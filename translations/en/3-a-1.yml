   <p> Made a cross-sectional study conducted between 15 December 2014 and 3 February 2015 with a representative sample of the Mozambican population between 15 and 64 years old, with more than 20000 households and assessed 3119 (95.2%) individuals were evaluated . </p>
   <p> The collection of information was carried out by eleven teams, one per Province, including three interviewers, responsible for the evaluation by questionnaire, and one meter, responsible for the physical and biochemical evaluations, in addition to elements responsible for the coordination and supervision and quality control of the fieldwork. </p>
   <p> The training took place from 20 to 31 October 2014, in Maputo, with a total of 55 candidate candidates and 11 meters, the training lasted for 144 hours. </p>

   <p> Under Law 7/96, which defines the general bases of the National Statistical System, the National Statistics Institute (INE), according to the Order published in the Boletim da Rep√∫blica No. 39/2000, Series I, of 27 September 2000, officially delegates the Directorate of Planning and Cooperation (DPC), of the Ministry of Health, the publication and dissemination of the official statistical information of the Health Sector, in Mozambique. </p>
RATIONALE: >2-
   <p> Tobacco use is a major contributor to disease and death from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). There is no proven level of safety in the use of tobacco or passive exposure to smoke. All daily and non-daily tobacco users are at risk for a variety of poor health outcomes throughout their lives, including NCDs. Reducing the prevalence of current tobacco use will make a major contribution to reducing premature mortality from NCDs (target 3.4). </p>
   <p> In addition to contributing to a detailed knowledge of the frequency of exposure to the main risk factors for NCDs in Mozambique, the information produced should allow to quantify the variation in these exposures in the last decade, through comparison with that observed in the first STEPS study, carried out in 2005. </p>
   <p> The results obtained in this study, allow a better knowledge of the Mozambican reality in relation to exposures associated with DNT, with potential interest for health planning, constituting itself as a baseline to evaluate the evolution of these risk factors with based on STEPS studies to be carried out in the future. </p>

   <p> The results obtained based on these elements of the data collection instrument allow a better knowledge of the Mozambican reality in relation to exposures that are associated with DNT, with potential interest for health planning, constituting itself as a baseline to evaluate the evolution of these risk factors based on STEPS studies to be carried out in the future. </p>
   <p> Monitoring the incidence and mortality due to NCD, as well as the levels of exposure to its main risk factors, is of great importance to define research and intervention priorities, as well as to assess the impact of health policies and to forecast the resources needed to address prevention and control needs. </p>

   <p> The World Health Organization (WHO) encouraged all low and middle income countries to use the STEPwise approach to Surveillance (STEPS) methodology as a way to promote the standardization of the assessment of the main risk factors of NCDs, in order to facilitate the comparison of results between populations and over time (http: // <a href="http://www.who.int/chp/steps/en"> www.who.int/chp/steps/en </a>) </p>
   <p> The STEPS methodology proposed by WHO (http: // <a href="http://www.who.int/chp/steps/en"> www.who.int/chp/steps/en </a>) was followed, with the collection of information by questionnaire, physical measurements and biochemical measurements. The study was approved by the National Committee on Bioethics for Health (Ref. 98 / CNBS / 14). </p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >2-
   <p> The evaluation of the participants was recorded on forms in physical support and the computerization of the data was performed centrally, at INE, between February and April 2016, using the interactive software Census and Survey Processing System (CSPRO), for microcomputers . This program allows you to interactively check the intervals of the variables, detect inconsistencies and control the internal flow of data during double entry of the questionnaires. </p>
