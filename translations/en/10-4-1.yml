   <p> The labor force share of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the total remuneration of employees, measured as a percentage of GDP, which is a measure of total production. It provides information on the relative share of production that is paid as compensation to employees, compared to the share paid to capital in the production process for a given reference period. </p>

COLL_METHOD: >2-
   <p> The Family Budget Survey is a probabilistic sampling survey with national, provincial and area of residence representation. Some of the important variables are household expenses, activities / occupations and people's remuneration / income and hours worked. It lasts for 12 months. The last two were held in 2014/15 and 2019/20. The interviews are direct. When recruiting, the interviewers are evaluated and selected, submitted to training, evaluation and selection. During the field work, there is supervision work for quality control and the data processing process starts with a data critique and the data entry is done in an appropriate computer application, with validation rules to control the quality. . </p>
   <p> Monthly and annual business surveys are current surveys, also probabilistic. Physical or electronic questionnaires are sent to companies for completion and return. They have as key variables: the main and secondary activity, the volume of business, expenses detailed by type of expenditure, No. of workers, remuneration and hours worked. And, like the IOF, they have their own computer applications with validation rules. </p>
   <p> Administrative data is received on templates used by sources. When they are received, an assessment is made of their quality. </p>

   <ol>
     <li> The National Statistics Institute (INE) is the central executive body of the National Statistical System (SEN) whose objective is the notation, calculation, coordination and dissemination of the country's official statistical information and is subordinate to the Minister Council. </li>
     <li> INE is responsible for carrying out the country's official statistical activity. </li>

RATIONALE: >2-
   <p> The share of labor in GDP seeks to inform about the relative share of GDP accumulated for workers compared to the accumulated share for capital in a given reference period. </p>
   <p> To effectively interpret this indicator, it is important to consider it, simultaneously, with economic growth trends. The share of labor remuneration in national production can highlight the extent to which economic growth translates into higher earnings for employees over time. It can be a proxy for the standard of living indicator for workers, depending on the distribution of real income and public policies adopted, among other factors </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >2-
   <p> Mozambique has a high bar of self-employed workers or in the informal sector, remuneration estimates can be underestimated, since the periodicity of the Family Budget Survey (IOF) is 5 years, a period considered long; </p>
   <p> The failure to carry out certain surveys on the scheduled date for budgetary reasons, leads institutions to make estimates that can be biased. </p>
   <p> GDP can exclude or underestimate activities that are difficult to measure, such as transactions in the informal sector or in illegal markets, etc., underestimating GDP. In addition, GDP is not responsible for the social and environmental costs of production and is therefore not a good measure of the general level of well-being. </p>
DATA_COMP: >2-
   <p> <strong> Share of work in GDP = Total compensation of employees / Gross Domestic Product * 100 </strong> </p>
   <p> As mentioned above, this method of calculation does not provide a comprehensive measure of the share of labor income, as it does not take into account the labor income of self-employed workers. </p>
   <p> Ideally, whenever possible, the numerator should be adjusted to include not only the remuneration of employees, but also the earnings of self-employed workers. </p>
