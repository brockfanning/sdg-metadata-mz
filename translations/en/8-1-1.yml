STAT_CONC_DEF: >2-
   <p> The annual growth rate of real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is calculated as the percentage change in real GDP per capita between two consecutive years. Real GDP per capita is calculated by dividing GDP at constant prices by the population of a country or region. Real GDP data is measured in constant US dollars to facilitate the calculation of the country's growth rates, their respective aggregation and comparability between countries or regions. </p>

SOURCE_TYPE: " <p> Monthly surveys, Annual surveys, Administrative data </p>"
COLL_METHOD: >2-
   <p> Monthly and annual business surveys are current, probabilistic surveys. Physical or electronic questionnaires are sent to companies for completion and return. They have as key variables: the main and secondary activity, the volume of business, expenses detailed by type of expenditure, No. of workers, remuneration and hours worked. They have their own computer applications with validation rules. </p>
   <p> Administrative data is received on models used by the sources. When they are received, an assessment is made of their quality. </p>

   <p> According to article 19, of Law 7/96 of July 5th: </p>
   <ol>
     <li> The National Statistics Institute (INE) is the central executive body of the National Statistical System (SEN) whose objective is the notation, calculation, coordination and dissemination of the country's official statistical information and is subordinate to the Minister Council. </li>
     <li> INE is responsible for carrying out the country's official statistical activity. </li>
   </ol>
RATIONALE: >2-
   <p> The Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is a proxy for the average standard of living of residents in a country or area. A positive percentage change in real annual GDP per capita can be interpreted as an increase in the average standard of living of residents in a country or area </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >2-
   <p> Lack of strict compliance with statistical legislation; </p>
   <p> Late reception of data from sources; </p>
   <p> Lack or insufficient resources to carry out surveys at regular intervals can lead to skewed production and transaction estimates. </p>
DATA_COMP: >2-
   <p> The annual growth rate of real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is calculated as follows: </p>
   <ol>
     <li> Convert the annual real GDP (constant prices) into the national currency of a country or region in US dollars using the base year exchange rate. </li>
     <li> Divide the result by the population of the country or region to obtain the annual real GDP per capita in US dollars. </li>
     <li> Calculate the annual growth rate of real GDP per capita in year t <sub> +1 </sub>, using the following formula: [(G (t <sub> +1 </sub>) - G (t) G (t <sub> +1 </sub>) is the real GDP per capita in dollars in year t <sub> +1 </sub> and G (t) is the real GDP per capita in dollars of the year t.
