RATIONALE: >2-
   <p> Poverty Index shows the percentage of people living on less than 26.7 meticais per day. For example, 46.1% means that 41.1% of people in Mozambique are poor, that is, they live on less than 26.7 meticais per day. </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >2-
   <p> The indicator is reliable, since the IOF data are representative at national, rural, urban and provincial levels. </p>
   <p> Limitations: In general, the great limitation in the calculation of this indicator comes from the general underestimation of household food consumption, evidenced by the low caloric consumption levels recorded in many areas of the country, and mainly due to problems in the collection of consumption data. </p>
DATA_COMP: >2-
   <p> The assessment of consumption poverty in Mozambique is based on the Basic Needs Cost approach, in which a poverty line is derived that includes food and non-food consumption, the limit at which those below are considered poor, and whoever is at the limit or above is considered to be non-poor. To calculate poverty we use the Foster, Greer and Thorbecke (FGT) indices, so for this indicator, we use the following Poverty Incidence Index: </p>
