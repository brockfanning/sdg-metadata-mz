DATA_COMP: >2-
   <p> For the analysis of multidimensional poverty in Mozambique, the methodology <em> Alkire-Foster </em> was used. This methodology allows the aggregation of dimensions and deprivation indicators. Our assessment was based on 17 indicators. As binary indicators, they can assume two values, 0 if the household is “non-private” and 1 if it is “private” for that indicator. Weights are assigned to dimensions and indicators. Subsequently, the limit (cutoff) of 40% of the heavy indicators was defined. Finally, private households at least 40% of private indicators were considered poor, and private households at less than 40% were considered non-poor. To calculate the Multidimensional Poverty Index of <em> Alkire-Foster </em> we use the following formula: </p>
