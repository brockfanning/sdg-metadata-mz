   <p> The Added Value of the Manufacturing Industry (VAIT) is a widely recognized indicator and widely used by researchers and policy makers to assess a country's level of industrialization. VAIT's share of GDP reflects the role of manufacturing industry in the economy and the national development of a country in general. VAIT per capita is the basic indicator of a country's level of industrialization adjusted for the size of the economy. One of the statistical uses of VAIT per capita is to classify groups of countries according to the stage of industrial development. </p>
