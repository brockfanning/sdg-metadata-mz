   <p> MISAU, Survey on Indicators of Immunization, Malaria and HIV / AIDS in Mozambique (IMASIDA) </p>
COLL_METHOD: >2-
   <p> The recommended data sources for calculating this indicator are Household Surveys. </p>
   <p> At IMASIDA, four questionnaires were used: </p>
   <p> - Questionnaire for households; </p>
   <p> - Individual questionnaire for young and adult women aged 15-59 years; </p>
   <p> - Individual questionnaire for young men and adults aged 15-59 years and </p>
   <p> - Biometry questionnaire for men and women aged 15-59 years. </p>
   <p> The four questionnaires were subsequently determined based on the findings of the pre-test of the survey, carried out between 14 April and 11 May 2014 </p>

   <p> The incidence rate provides a monitoring measure to prevent the progressive transmission of HIV </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >2-
   <p> Longitudinal data on individuals is the best source of data, but is rarely available for large populations. Special diagnostic tests in surveys or health facilities can be used to obtain data on HIV incidence. The incidence of HIV is modeled using the Spectrum software. </p>
DATA_COMP: >2-
   <p> The incidence rate is provided by the ratio between the number of new HIV cases and the number of people at risk </p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >2-
   <p> The field work had close supervision and quality control by the central and provincial technicians, both from INE, MISAU and ICF International staff. In addition, during the data collection, a strict control was established at the level of each team over the collection process, by detecting errors by the field critics, which allowed for immediate correction still on the ground. At the level of central coordination, the data critics carried out a further review of the base data and the problems encountered were communicated to the respective teams. </p>
   <p> The interactive and batch processing of information through the CSPro program also allowed, at central level, the periodic obtaining of partial results, for analysis of the data collected until a given moment, through the production of tables for monitoring and quality control. The results of these tabulations were reported in feedback to the interviewers, ensuring data quality. </p>

   <p> O The Immunization, Malaria and HIV / AIDS Indicators Survey in Mozambique (IMASIDA) is part of an international survey program (MEASURE DHS) developed by ICF International through a contract with USAID, with the purpose of supporting governments and private institutions in developing countries to carry out national sample surveys in the areas of population and health. The MEASURE DHS Program aims to: </p>
   <p> • Support the formulation of policies and implementation of programs in the areas of population and health; </p>
   <p> • Increase the international population and health data base for monitoring and evaluation; </p>
   <p> • Improve the survey methodology by sampling, and </p>
   <p> • Consolidate, in the survey area, the technical capacity of the executing institution in the country participating in the Program. </p>

   <p> In the data processing process, standard DHS Program procedures for CAFE4 inquiries were applied. The introduction of CAFE at IMASIDA 2015 ensured that the questionnaires started to be edited in the field, using a portable computer. After completing the questionnaires on paper and completing all interviews in the household, the interviewers and health technicians delivered the questionnaires to the field typist. The field typist, in conjunction with the team controller, reviewed the questionnaires and then typed them in the Census and Survey Process (CsPro) version 4.0. This typing process in the field allowed the detection of inconsistencies or omissions in the questionnaires, as well as the correction of them even on the ground, with the presence of the team in the conglomerate </p>
